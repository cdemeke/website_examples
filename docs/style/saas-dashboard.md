## Overview

SaaS dashboard interfaces prioritize functionality, data visualization, and user efficiency. They organize complex information into digestible components while maintaining a clean, professional appearance.

## Key Characteristics

- **Sidebar navigation** for quick access to features

- **Card-based layouts** for modular information
- **Dark/light mode** support
- **Responsive tables** and data grids
- **Action-oriented UI** with clear buttons and forms

## Prompts

### Analytics Dashboard
```
Create an analytics dashboard with a collapsible sidebar,
header with search and notifications, KPI cards at the top,
multiple chart types (line, bar, pie), a data table with
sorting and filtering, and date range selectors. Use a
dark theme with blue and green accent colors for positive
metrics.
```

### Project Management Dashboard
```
Design a project management dashboard with a kanban board
view, project cards with progress indicators, team member
avatars, deadline tracking, and activity feeds. Include
a left sidebar with project navigation and a top bar with
quick actions. Use a light theme with colorful status tags.
```

### CRM Dashboard
```
Build a CRM dashboard with a pipeline view, contact cards,
deal stages with drag-and-drop, activity timeline, email
integration preview, and revenue charts. Include quick-add
forms and search functionality. Use a professional blue
theme with clear data hierarchy.
