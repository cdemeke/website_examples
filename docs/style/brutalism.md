# Brutalism

## Overview

Brutalist web design draws inspiration from the architectural movement of the same name. It embraces raw, unpolished aesthetics, bold typography, and unconventional layouts that intentionally break traditional design rules.

## Key Characteristics

- **Raw, unfinished appearance** with visible structure
- **Bold, oversized typography** often in system fonts
- **High contrast** with stark color combinations
- **Asymmetrical layouts** that defy conventions
- **Minimal decoration** - function over form
- **Intentional "ugliness"** as an aesthetic choice
- **Exposed HTML/default styling** elements

## Prompts

### Raw Brutalist Site
```
Create a brutalist website with a stark black and white
color scheme. Use oversized Times New Roman or Courier
typography. Include visible borders, raw HTML-style
links (blue and underlined), and an intentionally
unpolished grid layout. No rounded corners, no shadows,
no gradients.
```

### Bold Brutalist Portfolio
```
Design a brutalist portfolio with clashing neon colors
on a black background. Use massive, overlapping headlines
that break the grid. Include raw image treatments with
no filtering, visible file names, and navigation that
feels more like a file directory than a menu.
```

### Anti-Design Brutalist
```
Build a website that rejects conventional design entirely.
Use mismatched fonts, jarring color combinations, elements
that overlap chaotically, and navigation hidden in
unexpected places. Make it feel like a statement against
polished corporate web design.
