# Swiss Design (International Typographic Style)

## Overview

Swiss Design, also known as the International Typographic Style, emphasizes cleanliness, readability, and objectivity. Originating in Switzerland in the 1950s, it uses grids, sans-serif typography, and asymmetric layouts to create highly functional designs.

## Key Characteristics

- **Grid-based layouts** with mathematical precision
- **Sans-serif typography** (especially Helvetica, Akzidenz-Grotesk)
- **Asymmetric but balanced** compositions
- **Objective photography** over illustration
- **Minimal decoration** - content is king
- **Strong typographic hierarchy** through size and weight
- **White space** as a design element

## Prompts

### Classic Swiss Layout
```
Create a website following Swiss Design principles.
Use a strict grid system, Helvetica or similar sans-serif
font, and an asymmetric layout. Limit colors to black,
white, and one accent color (red or blue). Emphasize
typography hierarchy and generous whitespace. No
decorative elements - let the content and structure
speak for itself.
```

### Swiss Editorial
```
Design an editorial website with Swiss typography
principles. Use a multi-column grid, flush-left ragged-right
text alignment, bold headlines in a heavy sans-serif,
and black-and-white photography. Include pull quotes
and clear section divisions using typography alone.
```

### Modernist Swiss
```
Build a modernist website inspired by Swiss Design.
Implement a visible grid system, use geometric shapes
sparingly, and maintain strict alignment. Include large
numerals, bold sans-serif headings, and minimal body
copy. Use red as the only accent against black and white.
```

## Color Palettes

### Classic Swiss

### Principles
- **Flush left, ragged right** alignment
- **Clear hierarchy** through size and weight
- **Generous line height** (1.4-1.6)
- **Limited font variations** - size and weight only

## Grid System

Swiss Design relies heavily on grids:
- Use 12-column grids for flexibility
- Maintain consistent gutters
- Align all elements to the grid
- Use mathematical ratios for spacing
