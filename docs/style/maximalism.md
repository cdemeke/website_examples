# Maximalism

## Overview

Maximalism is the bold rejection of "less is more." It embraces excess, layering, rich colors, patterns, and visual complexity to create immersive, memorable experiences that demand attention.

## Key Characteristics

- **Visual abundance** - more is more
- **Rich, saturated colors** often in unexpected combinations
- **Mixed patterns and textures** layered together
- **Bold typography** with decorative fonts
- **Dense layouts** with overlapping elements
- **Eclectic imagery** and illustrations
- **Animation and movement** throughout

## Prompts

### Eclectic Maximalist
```
Create a maximalist website with clashing patterns,
vibrant colors, and layered elements. Mix florals with
geometric shapes, use at least 5 different colors,
include decorative borders, and fill every space with
visual interest. Add animated elements and hover effects
that reveal more complexity.
```

### Luxury Maximalist
```
Design an opulent maximalist website with gold accents,
rich jewel tones (emerald, ruby, sapphire), ornate
typography, and baroque-inspired decorative elements.
Include textured backgrounds, intricate borders, and
layered imagery. Think royal excess and grandeur.
```

### Pop Maximalist
```
Build a pop-art inspired maximalist site with bold
primary colors, comic-style elements, halftone patterns,
and speech bubbles. Layer multiple visual elements,
use thick black outlines, and include animated GIFs
or stickers scattered throughout. Make it loud and fun.
