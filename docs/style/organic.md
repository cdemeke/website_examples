# Organic / Natural

## Overview

- **Natural textures** (wood, paper, stone, leaves)
- **Flowing, asymmetric layouts** avoiding rigid grids
- **Hand-drawn or organic illustrations**
- **Warm, inviting atmosphere**
- **Sustainable and eco-friendly associations**

## Prompts

### Natural Wellness Site
```
Create an organic website for a wellness brand. Use
soft, rounded shapes and a palette of sage green,
warm beige, and terracotta. Include flowing wave
dividers between sections, botanical illustrations,
and paper textures. Typography should feel warm with
rounded sans-serifs or gentle serifs.
```

### Eco-Friendly Brand
```
Design a sustainable brand website with an earthy
aesthetic. Use recycled paper textures, forest greens,
and natural browns. Include hand-drawn leaf motifs,
organic blob shapes for containers, and photography
of nature. Convey environmental consciousness through
every design choice.
```

### Artisan Food Site
```
Build a website for an artisan food company with
organic styling. Feature warm wood textures, cream
backgrounds, and hand-illustrated food elements.
Use a friendly serif font for headings and include
watercolor-style accents. The design should feel
handcrafted and authentic.
