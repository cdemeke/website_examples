- **Unique, personality-driven design**
- **Minimal text**, letting work speak for itself
- **Project filtering** by category or type

## Prompts

### Designer Portfolio
```
Create a portfolio website for a graphic designer with
a dark theme. Use a masonry grid layout for projects
with smooth hover effects that reveal project details.
Include a brief about section, a filterable project
gallery, and a simple contact form. Add subtle parallax
scrolling effects.
```

### Photographer Portfolio
```
Design a photography portfolio with full-bleed images.
Use a horizontal scrolling gallery for the homepage,
with categorized albums. Include a minimal navigation
overlay, smooth image transitions, and lightbox
functionality. Keep text minimal with just the
photographer's name and contact info.
```

### Developer Portfolio
```
Build a developer portfolio with a modern, technical
aesthetic. Include a hero with animated text or code
snippets, a project grid with tech stack tags, a
skills section with visual indicators, GitHub
integration for live stats, and a timeline for
experience. Use a dark mode design with neon accents.
