# Landing Page Style

## Overview

Landing pages are single-focus, conversion-optimized pages designed to drive a specific action. They combine compelling copy, strategic design, and clear CTAs to maximize conversions.

## Key Characteristics

- **Single, clear objective** (signup, download, purchase)
- **Compelling hero section** with value proposition
- **Social proof** (testimonials, logos, statistics)
- **Benefit-focused content** over feature lists
- **Minimal navigation** to reduce distractions
- **Multiple CTAs** strategically placed

## Prompts

### SaaS Product Launch
```
Create a SaaS landing page with a gradient hero section,
animated product mockup, three key benefits with icons,
customer testimonial carousel, pricing comparison table,
FAQ accordion, and a sticky CTA button. Use a modern
design with a primary purple color and smooth scroll
animations.
```

### App Download Page
```
Design a mobile app landing page with a phone mockup
hero, feature highlights with alternating layouts,
app store badges, user reviews, and download statistics.
Use a vibrant gradient background with floating UI
elements. Include an animated demo or video.
```

### Event Registration
```
Build an event landing page with a countdown timer,
speaker profiles, agenda/schedule, venue information,
early-bird pricing, and registration form. Use an
exciting color scheme with the event branding. Include
