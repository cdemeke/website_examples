# Minimalist Style

## Overview

Minimalist websites prioritize simplicity, clean lines, and intentional use of whitespace. Every element serves a purpose, and the design removes all unnecessary components.

## Key Characteristics

- **Generous whitespace** between elements
- **Limited color palette** (often monochromatic or 2-3 colors)
- **Typography-focused** design
- **Simple navigation** with few menu items
- **No decorative elements** that don't serve a function
- **High contrast** for readability

## Prompts

### Basic Minimalist Site
```
Create a minimalist website with a clean white background,
ample whitespace, and a single accent color. Use a modern
sans-serif font. The navigation should be simple with no
more than 4 items. Focus on typography hierarchy to guide
the user's eye.
```

### Minimalist Portfolio
```
Design a minimalist portfolio website with a grid-based
layout. Use black and white with one accent color for
hover states. Large project images should be the focus,
with minimal text descriptions. Include subtle animations
on scroll.
```

### Minimalist Landing Page
```
Build a single-page minimalist landing page with sections
separated by generous padding. Use a maximum of two fonts.
The hero section should have a single headline and one
call-to-action button. Remove all unnecessary UI elements.
```
