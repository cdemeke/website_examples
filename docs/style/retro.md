# Retro / Vintage

## Overview

Retro and vintage web design draws inspiration from past decades - from 70s earth tones to 80s neon to 90s web aesthetics. These designs evoke nostalgia while creating unique, memorable experiences.

## Key Characteristics

- **Era-specific color palettes** (earth tones, neon, pastels)
- **Period typography** (disco fonts, pixel fonts, serif classics)
- **Textured backgrounds** (paper, grain, noise)
- **Vintage imagery** (halftones, duotones, illustrations)
- **Retro UI elements** (beveled buttons, pixel art)
- **Nostalgic motifs** (cassettes, VHS, old computers)

## Prompts

### 70s Groovy
```
Create a 1970s-inspired website with warm earth tones
(burnt orange, avocado green, mustard yellow, brown).
Use groovy display fonts with rounded letterforms,
wavy decorative elements, and sunburst patterns. Include
textured paper backgrounds and vintage photography with
warm filters.
```

### 80s Synthwave
```
Design a synthwave/retrowave website with a neon color
scheme (hot pink, electric blue, purple) on a dark
background. Include grid patterns, sunset gradients,
chrome text effects, and geometric shapes. Add scan
lines and VHS-style glitch effects for authenticity.
```

### 90s Web Aesthetic
```
Build a 90s-style website with the classic web aesthetic.
Use a tiled background, visitor counter, "under construction"
GIFs, beveled buttons, Times New Roman font, and a
guestbook section. Include rainbow dividers, marquee
text, and a starfield background. Embrace the chaos.
```

### Y2K Aesthetic
```
Create a Y2K-inspired website with silver/chrome elements,
baby blue and pink colors, bubble fonts, and futuristic
optimism. Include glossy buttons, star motifs, and
cyber-inspired graphics. Think early 2000s pop culture.
